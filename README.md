# Repository for Data Engineering Zoomcamp, Homework 1

Not a terribly neat repository yet, but should get better 
as the course progresses.

N.B. Used Windows for homework #1, and that has its own challenges.
May switch to WSL2 for everything else going forward, but that 
means copying keys and such into the WSL setup, and re-working
some setup inside WSL.
