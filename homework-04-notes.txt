Question 1. dbt Lineage and Execution

Given a dbt project with the following structure:

```
models/
├── staging/
│   ├── stg_green_tripdata.sql
│   └── stg_yellow_tripdata.sql
└── intermediate/
    └── int_trips_unioned.sql (depends on stg_green_tripdata & stg_yellow_tripdata)
```

if you run `dbt run --select int_trips_unioned`, what models will be built?

* `stg_green_tripdata`, `stg_yellow_tripdata`, and `int_trips_unioned` (upstream dependencies)
* Any model with upstream and downstream dependencies to `int_trips_unioned`
* `int_trips_unioned` only
* `int_trips_unioned`, `int_trips`, `fct_trips` (downstream dependencies)

ANSWER:
* `int_trips_unioned` only

Elaboration:

There are other notations that can be used with the `dbt run --select`:

There are lots of variations and "graph operators" which allow one to
ask `dbt` to build all of the "downstream descendants," for example.

In order to ask for the construction/derivation of `int_trips_unioned` and its
upstream dependencies, `stg_green_tripdata` and `stg_yellow_tripdata`, one would use the command:

```
dbt run --select +int_trips_unioned
```

Question 2. dbt Tests

You've configured a generic test like this in your `schema.yml` :

```
columns:
  - name: payment_type
    data_tests:
      - accepted_values:
          arguments:
            values: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
            quote: false
```

Your model `fct_trips` has been running successfully for months.  A new value `6` now appears in the source data.

What happens when you run `dbt --test --select fct_trips`?


* dbt will skip the test because the model didn't change
* dbt will fail the test, returning a non-zero exit code
* dbt will pass the test with a warning about the new value
* dbt will update the configuration to include the new value
