## Homework 4
### Question 1. dbt Lineage and Execution

Given a dbt project with the following structure:

```
models/
├── staging/
│   ├── stg_green_tripdata.sql
│   └── stg_yellow_tripdata.sql
└── intermediate/
    └── int_trips_unioned.sql (depends on stg_green_tripdata & stg_yellow_tripdata)
```

if you run `dbt run --select int_trips_unioned`, what models will be built?

* `stg_green_tripdata`, `stg_yellow_tripdata`, and `int_trips_unioned` (upstream dependencies)
* Any model with upstream and downstream dependencies to `int_trips_unioned`
* `int_trips_unioned` only
* `int_trips_unioned`, `int_trips`, `fct_trips` (downstream dependencies)

ANSWER:
* `int_trips_unioned` only

Elaboration:

There are other notations that can be used with the `dbt run --select`:

There are lots of variations and "graph operators" which allow one to
ask `dbt` to build all of the "downstream descendants," for example.

In order to ask for the construction/derivation of `int_trips_unioned` and its
upstream dependencies, `stg_green_tripdata` and `stg_yellow_tripdata`, one would use the command:

```
dbt run --select +int_trips_unioned
```

Also, the `dbt ls --select +int_trips_unioned` would show you what would be "run" without
running it; `dbt ls` lets you see what the "graph selection syntax" allows you to
specify.

### Question 2. dbt Tests

You've configured a generic test like this in your `schema.yml` :

```
columns:
  - name: payment_type
    data_tests:
      - accepted_values:
          arguments:
            values: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
            quote: false
```

Your model `fct_trips` has been running successfully for months.  A new value `6` now appears in the source data.

What happens when you run `dbt --test --select fct_trips`?


* dbt will skip the test because the model didn't change
* dbt will fail the test, returning a non-zero exit code
* dbt will pass the test with a warning about the new value
* dbt will update the configuration to include the new value

ANSWER;
* dbt will fail the test, returning a non-zero exit code

Elaboration:

I tried to explore this behavior by tweaking the `taxi_rides-ny/models/marts/schema.yml`
by adding `data_tests` to the column definition for `payment_type` and adding
the `accepted_values` tests in the manner described above:

```
      - name: payment_type
        description: Payment method code
        data_type: integer
        data_tests:
        - accepted_values:
            arguments:
              values: [1, 2, 3, 4]
              quote: false
```

and then ran a `dbt build --select fct_trips --full-refresh` to get `dbt` to
show me what an error condition and test failure looks like when it finds
values of 5 in column `payment_type`.

### Question 3. Counting Records in `fct_monthly_zone_revenue`

After running your dbt project, query the `fct_monthly_zone_revenue` model.

What is the count of records in the `fct_monthly_zone_revenue` model?

```
    12,998
    14,120
    12,184
    15,421
```

ANSWER:

```
    12,184
```

Elaboration:

```
select count(*) row_tally from `dbt_rstewart.fct_monthly_zone_revenue`;
```

yielded the correct result, *after* executing `dbt build --target -prod --full-refresh`
to derived correct population of data, after I discovered that I had typos in the
uri's used to query the "data lake csv.gz files" that had been loaded into cloud
storage!

### Question 4. Best Performing Zone for Green Taxis (2020)

Using the `fct_monthly_zone_revenue` table, find the pickup zone with the highest total revenue (`revenue_monthly_total_amount`) for *Green* taxi trips in 2020.

Which zone had the highest revenue?

    * East Harlem North
    * Morningside Heights
    * East Harlem South
    * Washington Heights South

ANSWER:
    * East Harlem North


Elaboration:

The following query yielded the answer:

```
select t.pickup_zone, sum(t.revenue_monthly_total_amount) tot_revenue, t.service_type  
from `dbt_rstewart.fct_monthly_zone_revenue` t 
where 
    t.service_type = 'Green' 
and 
    '2020-01-01' <= t.revenue_month and t.revenue_month <= '2020-12-01'
group by t.pickup_zone, t.service_type
order by sum(t.revenue_monthly_total_amount) desc;
```

=============================================================

### Question 5. Green Taxi Trip Counts (October 2019)

Using the fct_monthly_zone_revenue table, what is the total number of trips (total_monthly_trips) for Green taxis in October 2019?

```
    500,234
    350,891
    384,624
    421,509
```

ANSWER:

```
    384,624
```

Elaboration:

```
select sum(t.total_monthly_trips) sum_tot_monthly_trips
from `dbt_rstewart.fct_monthly_zone_revenue` t where t.service_type='Green' and t.revenue_month = '2019-10-01';
```

=============================================================

### Question 6. Build a Staging Model for FHV Data

Create a staging model for the *For-Hire Vehicle (FHV)* trip data for 2019.

  1.  Load the [FHV trip data](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/tag/fhv) for 2019 into your data warehouse
  2.  Create a staging model `stg_fhv_tripdata` with these requirements:
      * Filter out records where `dispatching_base_num` IS NULL
      * Rename fields to match your project's naming conventions (e.g., `PUlocationID` → `pickup_location_id`)

What is the count of records in stg_fhv_tripdata?

  * 42,084,899
  * 43,244,693
  * 22,998,722
  * 44,112,187
